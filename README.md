Simple Subreddit Image Downloader
==========================
Tired of all of those reddit downloaders which want you to install tons of dependencies and then don't work anyway? Me too.

*Simple Subreddit Image Downloader* is bash script which:
- downloads ALL images from specified subreddit in full size
- Linux/MacOS/Windows
- Parallel download

This script just downloads all directly linked images in subreddit. It can also download with a specific sort. For more complex usage, use other reddit image downloader.

Requirements
============
- bash (cygwin is OK)
- curl
- jq

Usage
=====
```
./download-subreddit-images.sh <subreddit_name>
./download-subreddit-images.sh <subreddit_name> <hot|new|rising|top>
./download-subreddit-images.sh <subreddit_name> top <all|year|month|week|day>
```

Script downloads images to `<subreddit_name>` folder in current directory. If you want to change that, you need to edit destination in rdit.sh for now.
